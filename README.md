## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am BjÃ¶rn, a PhD candidate at ETH Zurich, specializing in **egocentric and camera-based physiological sensing for intelligent computer agents and health applications**. My research focuses on advancing these systems by leveraging remotely estimated physiological and affective states derived solely from video data. By analyzing a personâ€™s physiological state, I aim to enhance the understanding of their emotions, intent, and health, ultimately improving the quality of personalized assistance.

- ðŸ”­ **Dataset recordings**: During the initial phase of my PhD, I focused on recording **multimodal datasets** comprising synchronized egocentric and third-person camera recordings along with physiological signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrodermal activity (EDA).
- ðŸ¤” **Machine learning:** Currently, I am developing novel deep learning techniques to estimate these physiological signals from the recorded videos and infer a person's **affective state**.
- âš¡ **Future applications:** Ultimately, I aim to enhance intelligent computer agents and healthcare applications using these physiological and affective indicators to provide better **user-aware, personalized assistance**.
