## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am BjÃ¶rn, a PhD candidate at ETH Zurich, specializing in **deep learning, computer vision and non-contact physiological sensing**. My research focuses on developing novel deep learning models that predict a person's emotions and physiological signalsâ€”such as heart rateâ€”from egocentric systems (e.g., Project Aria glasses), videos, and wearable devices. 

- ðŸ”­ **Dataset recordings**: During the initial phase of my PhD, I focused on recording several **multimodal datasets**  comprising synchronized egocentric and third-person camera recordings along with emotions and physiological signals, such as photoplethysmograms (PPG) and electrodermal activity (EDA).
- ðŸ¤” **Machine learning:** Currently, I am developing novel deep learning techniques to estimate these physiological signals from the recorded (egocentric) videos and infer a person's **affective state**.
- âš¡ **Future applications:** Ultimately, I aim to enhance contextual AI and healthcare approaches with the help of these signals by better understanding a user's behavior and internal state.

Prior to my PhD, I completed a master's degree in Robotics, Systems and Control and a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, both from ETH Zurich.
